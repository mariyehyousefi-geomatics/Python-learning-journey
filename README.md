# Python Learning Journey (GIS & WebGIS Focus)

A collection of Python scripts I’m writing during my GIS/Python training.
This repository documents my 4‑month learning path toward becoming a GIS & WebGIS developer.

---

## 📍 About This Journey
I have an academic background in Geomatics (Civil/Surveying) and Transportation Engineering.  
My goal is to gain strong Python skills for:
- GIS automation  
- spatial data analysis  
- WebGIS development  
- remote job opportunities in the GIS/Geospatial field  

This repository contains all my weekly exercises, notes, and small projects.

## 📅 Learning Roadmap (4 Months)
This roadmap includes:
- Python fundamentals (syntax, variables, strings, lists, dicts)
- Control flow & functions  
- Working with files & CSV  
- GIS fundamentals  
- Geopandas (vector analysis)  
- Shapely (geometry operations)  
- Raster basics  
- WebGIS with Leaflet & Mapbox  
- Final full‑stack GIS project (Python API + JavaScript map)

I will update this file continuously as I progress.
